- [Girflow Renference](atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)


### Feature develop

- Feature branches use develop as their parent branch.
- When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop.
- Each new feature should reside in its own branch.
- Features should never interact directly with master.
- The develop branch is a protected branch, and MR must be initiated, after  a code review by a writer.
